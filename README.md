Open Science Software for Semantic Synthesis and Extraction of Information from Unstructured Sources.

## About
`alembica` simplifies the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured data sets from unstructured corpora of text. It provides a flexible and scalable framework to process, synthesize, and transform textual information of any type. The output is structured into formats suitable for analysis and further processing.

## Features
- **Validation of Input**: Ensures that queries are correctly formatted to support proper interaction with models.
- **Cost Assessment**: Calculates the cost of submitted input tokens based on the requested extraction and different model pricing.
- **Data Extraction**: Processes unstructured text and transforms it into structured datasets for further analysis.
